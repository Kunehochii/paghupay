Students often raise questions about the privacy of what is discussed in counselling.
All TUPV Guidance Staff adhere to very strict confidentiality standards.

1. Any information or counselling records that you provide are strictly confidential, except in life threatening situations, cases of suspected child or elder abuse, or when release is otherwise required by law.

2. In order to provide the best services possible, your counsellor may consult with other counselors in the Guidance Services Office.

3. Information about the counselling will not appear in your academic record.

4. In order to protect your right to confidentiality, your written authorization is required if you want us to provide information about your counselling to another person or agency. If you have any question, you may ask your intake counsellor.
